  morningRoutine: `## Morning Routine Blueprint ðŸŒ…

A science-backed morning routine can set you up for an incredibly productive day:

1. **Wake consistently** (5:30-7:00 AM) - Your body loves predictability
2. **Hydrate immediately** - 16oz water with lemon to kickstart metabolism
3. **Move for 5-10 minutes** - Light stretching or yoga to activate your body
4. **Meditate briefly** - Just 5 minutes reduces cortisol by up to 20%
5. **Journal gratitude** - Write 3 things you're grateful for
6. **Set 3 priorities** for your day

**Would you like me to help you design a custom morning routine based on your specific goals?**`,

  focus: `## Focus-Boosting Habits ðŸ§ 

Research shows these habits can dramatically improve focus:

1. **Daily meditation** - Even 10 minutes improves attention span by up to 14%
2. **"Deep work" blocks** - 90-minute focused sessions with no distractions
3. **Pomodoro technique** - 25 minutes work + 5 minutes rest
4. **Proper hydration** - Just 1% dehydration reduces cognitive performance by 5%
5. **Consistent sleep schedule** - Aim for 7-9 hours within the same timeframe

**The most impactful habit is probably creating dedicated "deep work" blocks. Would you like tips on implementing this?**`,

  consistency: `## Consistency Framework ðŸ”„

Here's how behavioral science says we stay consistent:

1. **Start tiny** - A 2-minute version of your habit is more sustainable
2. **Habit stacking** - Attach new habits to existing routines (e.g., "After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 1 minute")
3. **Track visually** - Use a habit tracker or calendar to create a "don't break the chain" effect
4. **Accountability partner** - 95% higher completion rate with social accountability
5. **Environment design** - Make good habits obvious and easy; bad habits invisible and difficult

> "We don't rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems." - James Clear

**Which of these would you like me to explain in more detail?**`,

  motivation: `## Motivation Mastery ðŸ”¥

When motivation fades (and it will), use these evidence-based strategies:

1. **Connect to your "why"** - Write down your deeper purpose behind the habit
2. **Visualize future you** - Spend 2 minutes daily imagining your improved future self
3. **Identity-based habits** - Focus on becoming the type of person who does X
4. **Celebrate small wins** - Your brain needs regular dopamine hits to stay motivated
5. **Adjust difficulty** - If you're struggling, make the habit easier temporarily

**Remember: Motivation is what gets you started, but systems keep you going.**`,

  progress: `## Tracking Progress Effectively ðŸ“Š

Here are the most effective ways to track your habit progress:

1. **HabitNest tracker** - Use our built-in tools to visualize your streak
2. **Habit journal** - Rate your habits daily (1-10) and note observations
3. **Weekly reviews** - Schedule Sunday reviews to assess what's working
4. **Measurable metrics** - Define specific numbers to track (minutes, reps, etc.)
5. **Progress photos** - Visual evidence is incredibly motivating

**Would you like me to help you set up a tracking system for a specific habit?**`,

  default: `Hi, I'm your HabitNest assistant! ðŸ‘‹

I can help you build better habits and achieve your goals through science-backed strategies. Here are a few things I can help with:

- Creating personalized habit routines
- Overcoming motivation and consistency challenges
- Tracking your progress effectively
- Understanding the psychology behind habit formation

**What specific habit or goal are you working on right now?**`
